        Learn when to stop. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Let that brush dance around there and play.

        I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. I really believe that if you practice enough you could paint the 'Mona Lisa' with a two-inch brush. It's beautiful - and we haven't even done anything to it yet. Working it up and down, back and forth. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world.

        I really recommend you use odorless thinner or your spouse is gonna run you right out into the yard and you'll be working by yourself. Now then, let's play. We don't make mistakes we just have happy little accidents. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush.
